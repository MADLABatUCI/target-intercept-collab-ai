Instructions HTML file.

This file contains all of the instructions for a given experiment.

Each instruction page should be in it's own <div> and should have
a unique instruction page number. Page 1 will NOT be visible by default.
Page 1 will be made visible through JS code, this ensures that the
timer for instruction page 1 is started at the correct time.
The rest of the pages will become visible as a participant
navigates through the instructions. An example of an instruction page
<div> can be seen below:

    <div class="col-12" id="instruction-page-02" hidden="true">
        Instructions Page 2

        All instruction page information goes here! You should
        add all necessary elements here to make your instruction
        page clear and concise.
    </div>

The instructions navigator will be automatically generated by the
code provided. Just be sure to update the js/instructions.js
file appropriately!

                    Note that by default all instruction pages have 3 different lines for text.
                    Not all lines need to be present for the instructions to work. You can also
                    add more lines (by adding more headers and text) as you need (just be sure
                    that you style them correctly in the css/instruction.css file).

                    There are only 10 instruction pages by default. You can add more pages as
                    needed. Just be sure to update the js/instructions.js file appropriately.
