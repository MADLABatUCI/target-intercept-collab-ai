<h2>
Basic overview of the code.
</h2>

Before diving into the details, we need to go into the general way these pages work. Specifically, unique HTML pages have accompanying JavaScript to run the individual game components. The exeperiment is broken down into three main sections: 1. Consent, 2. Interactive game \& experiment instructions, 3. The full experiment.

_'index.html'_ initializes the web interface for the code. 


<h2>
Instruction section flow.
</h2>

There are a range of different game components one can initialize in this game. To begin with, there is an interactive instruction section that involves 4 gameplay sections that teach, successivelly, how to play the game. Instructions begin with 'instructions.html' which points to the these successive pages: 

_'instructions.html'_ --> _'instructions-gameplay-pg1.html'_ --> _'instructions-gameplay-pg2.html'_ --> _'instructions-gameplay-pg3.html'_ --> _'instructions-gameplay-pg4.html'_ --> _'instructions-AI.html'_.

After _'instructions-AI.html'_, which informs the player about the presence of an AI collaborator, the participant is sent is sent to _'integrity-pledge.html'_ where all participants sign an integrity pledge. After signing this, the player is sent to the main experiment, _'game-main-exp.html'_. Once the particpant has completed the experiment, they are redirected to _'complete.html'_ where there is a redirect code back to Prolific.

<h3>
The JavaScript children of each of the fornamed HTML pages:
</h3>

* _'instructions.html'_ -- _'instructions.js'_
* _'instructions-gameplay-pg1.html'_ --_'instructions-gameplay-pg1.js'_
* _'instructions-gameplay-pg2.html'_ -- _'instructions-gameplay-pg2.js'_
* _'instructions-gameplay-pg3.html'_ -- _'instructions-gameplay-pg3.js'_
* _'instructions-gameplay-pg4.html'_ -- _'instructions-gameplay-pg4.js'_
* _'instructions-AI.html'_ -- _'instructions-AI.js'_
* _'integrity-pledge.html'_ -- '_integrity-pledge.js'_
* _'game-main-exp.html'_ -- _'new-interface-all-agents.js'_
* _'complete.html'_ -- _'complete.js'_


<h2>
Main experiment game and AI code.

<h3>
Overview of the main experiment.
</h3>

There are three important files that control the final experimental function and interface: _'game-main-exp.html'_ , _'new-interface-all-agents.js'_, _'AIplannerv1.5'_. Together, these control the important flow of the experiment. _'game-main-exp.html'_ controls all the HTML elements and intializes the game engine _'new-interface-all-agents.js'_. The underlying path planning algorithm for each of the collaborative AI agents is in _'AIplannerv1.5'_.

<h3>
Understanding the game engine: 'new-interface-all-agents.js'
</h3>

_'new-interface-all-agents.js'_ could be broken down into a few main sections: 

1. Database intialization.
2. Experiment set-up.
3. Rendering and drawing.
4. Game updates.
4. Event handling.
5. Surveys.

<h3>
Skipping through different sections of the game:
</h3>
Starting at line 93 (in the DEBUG conditional), you can manipulate which of the gameplay components to individually open. The default is loading the 'consent.html' page which is the first page all actual participants will encounter. However, you can skip into 1. the main experiment, & 2. the interactive instruction section pages. To do this, you need only intialize the correct HTML attribute that accompanies that page. The code that does this is there for you to uncomment and skip into each of those pages.
